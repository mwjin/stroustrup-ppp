# Chapter 3 Review (p. 84 ~ 85)
1. A **prompt** is a message which encourages users to take an action.

2. `>>`

3. ```c++
   cout << "Enter a number: ";
   cin >> number;
   ```

4. This character is called a **newline** character. This character is used to represent the end of a line and the beginning of a next line.

5. **Whitespace**, which is a space, a newline, and a tab character.

6. **Whitespace**

7. ```c++
   cout << "Hello, " << first_name << "!\n";
   ```

8. An **object** is a region of memory with a *type* that specifies the meaning of a value in this region.

9. A **literal** represents a value of various types

10. There are *integer*, *floating point*, *string*, *char*, and *boolean* literals.

11. A **variable** is a named *object*.

12. 1 byte, 4 bytes, and 8 bytes, respectively.

13. Byte

14. `=` is an assignment operator. `==` is a logical operator to compare two values for equality.

15. A **definition** means a statement that introduces a new name into a program and sets aside memory for a variable.

16. An **initialization** is to create a variable with its initial value. Whereas an **assignment** is to give a new value to a variable that has *already existed*.

17. **String concatenation** is to link multiple strings end-to-end. In C++, *+* operator for strings means string concatenation.

    - Definition of a legal name: a variable name that is allowed by a compiler.
    - Legal names: This_little_pig, MiniMineMine, number
    - Illegal names with the reason
      - This_1_is fine, latest thing: *Whitespaces* are not allowed as a character of a variable name.
      - 2_For_1_special: A numeric character cannot be the first character of a variable name.
      - the_$12_method: *$* is not allowed as a character of a variable name. (This is controversial because *$* is allowed in some machines.)
      - correct?:  *?* is not allowed as a character of a variable name.
      - _this_is_ok: This variable name may be allowed by a compiler. However, you should not use such names because these are reserved for implementation and system entities.
